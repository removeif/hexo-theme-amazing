形容词做定语放在被修饰词前面

完整句子做定语放在被修饰词后面

#### 定语从句的重要概念

**先行词**：被修饰或限定的词（the people） <!-- more -->

**关系词**：重复指代先行词，起连接作用并在定语从句中充当成分

   **代词作用**：重复指代先行词，从句中充当成分

   **连接作用**：连接主句和从句的作用 

#### 关系代词的用法

  先行词指人`who，whom`

  先行词指物`which`

  先行词指人或物均可：`that，whose`

####  先行词指人

  **who和whom区别**

+ **`who`在从句中`可做主语，宾语，表语`，但who之前不可用介词**

​      I like the people `who` I work with

​      I like the people `with whom` I work

+ **`whom`在定语从句中`不能做主语`，可以`做表语或宾语`**

​      A rich person is not one `who` has the most, but is one `who` needs the least. 

+ **表示人或物的所有关系：whose + 名词：在从句中可做`主语，动词宾语，介词宾语**`

+ **c. which可以指代前面整个句子**

​    **She wore her swimming things in the office**, `which` shocked her boss a great deal. 

**非限定性定语从句：被修饰的句子不需要定语从句意思也完整，只是补充说明**

#### that指代人或指代物：注意`不可以用在介词后面`

  The world `that/which` we live in is made up of matter.

  The world in `which` we live is made up of matter.

#### 最好用that情况

+ **先行词有人也有物时，用that**

​    The writer and his novels `that` the article deals with are quite familiar to us.

* **先行词为指物的all, little, few, much, none, the first用that**

​    a. All that glitters is not gold.

​    b. This book contains little that is useful.

​    c. There is not much that can be done.

​    d. As long as you stand up to the difficulties, there are none that cannot be overcome.

+ **先行词是不定代词something, anything, nothing, everything用that**

​    a. Is there ***anything*** that I can do for you?

​    b.Greater expense does not always equal better gift, I would much rather receive **a gift** that was unique or that I knew my friend had put some thought into rather than **something** that cost a lot of money but that I didn’t need or want. I would much rather receive **something** that made me laugh, made me reminisce, or fit my personality that **something** that cost a lot but that I will just throw  in my closet and forget about.

#### 关系代词省略

  **关系代词who, whom, which, that 若在定语从句中用作宾语，可以省略**

​    a. Tina likes the present which I gave her for her birthday.

​    b. Tina likes the present that I gave her for her birthday.

​    c. Tina likes the present I gave her for ther birthday.

​    e. I like the people I work with.

​    f. I’m talking about friends who you can share almost everything with.

​    g. I’m talking abouot friends you can share almost everything with.

#### 关系副词的用法：when, where, why，从句中做时间状语，地点状语， 原因状语

+ **先行词指时间**

​    when 引导限制性和非限制性定语从句，先行词须是表示***时间的名词***

​    day, year, time,      ***when可以用on which来替换***

​    a. I’ll never forget ***the day*** when I met you.

​    b. I’ll never forget ***the day*** on which I met you.

​    c. We will put off the outing until ***next week***, when we won’t be so busy.

​    d. The ***day*** may soon come when we don’t bother to go to office but just work at home.

+  **关系副词when在从句中做时间状语**

​    ***当心***：`表示时间的先行词，若定语从句中不缺少状语和是缺少宾语或主语，要用which或`

`that来引导定语从句。因为when来引导定语从句的前提条件是：when 在其引导的定语从句中做时间状语。`

​     a. ***The day***, which began brightly, ended with a violent storm. (which做主语)

​     b. I’ll never forget ***the time*** which I spent on campus. (which做spent宾语)

​     c. I’ll never forget ***the day*** when we first met in the park. (when做时间状语修饰met)

 

#### where的用法 = at which或in which

+ **where引导定语从句，先行词必须是表示地点的名词，如place, house**

​    a. Do you know ***any place*** where I can buy Clint’s grammar book?

​    b. Do you know ***any place*** at which I can buy Clint’s grammar book?

​    c. This is ***the town*** where(in which) I spent my childhood.

​    d. This is ***the restaurant*** where I often have my breakfast.

+ **关系副词where在从句中做地点状语**

​    b. This is ***the town*** which I told you about before. which做about的宾语

​    c. The library **where** students often study was on fire last night.

​    d. The library, **which** was built in the 1930’s, needs to be renovated.

​    e. One of the ***places*** which I want to visit someday is Tibet. which做visit宾语

 

**why的用法：只用来引导限制定语从句，先行词是reason等表示原因的名词**

**因为说明原因，所以不是补充说明，不能做非限制定语从句 = for which**

  This is ***the reason*** why I didn’t come here 

#### 限制性和非限制性的定语从句

   形式上：有无 “，” 分割开来

**限制性定语从句**

​     作用：用来提供必要的信息，限定身份或性质，限制范围，若去掉从句，含义不明

​     例子：I don’t like people意思不明

​          I don’t like people who never keep their words.

**非限制性定语从句**

​     作用：提供附加的非必要信息，补充说明或解释，去掉从句，不会引起误解。

​     例子：Beijing, which is the capital of China, has developed into an international city.

**如果定语从句修饰一个专有名词，我用一般用逗号，就是要用非限定性定语从句。**

**因为专有名词本身意思已经很完整，不需要限制，只是用定语从句进行补充**

#### 用不用逗号的句子意义有差别

| 限制性                                             | 非限制性                                           | 解释                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| he has a daughter who works in a hospital          | he has a daughter, who works in a hospital         | a，表示他有多个女儿，其中一个在医院工作b，强调他有一个女儿，不是儿子，在医院工作 |
| the food which wasn’t in  the fridge all went off. | the food, which wasn’t in the fridge, all went off | a，没有放在冰箱里的那部分食物坏了b，食物都坏了，因为没有放在冰箱里。此时的定语从句补充说明变坏的原因。 |

  `限制性定语从句一般翻译成定语形式“….的”`

  **非性质性定语从句往往翻译成各种状语**

  a. the food, which wasn’t in the fridge, all went off.

​     **翻译成原因状语从句**

  b. the Ambassador gave a dinner to the scientists, with whom the especially wished to talk

​     **翻译成原因状语从句**

  c. the people were desperate for work, any work, which could support their family.

​     **条件状语从句**

  d. the millionaire had another house built, which he didn’t need at all

​     **让语状语从句**

#### that引导的定语从句和同位语从句的区别

+ **that是否做成分：that在定语从句中充当成分，在同位语从句中不做任何成分**

​     a. the rumor that he spread everywhere turned out to be untrue.

​     b. the rumor that tom was a thief turned out to be untrue.

​     a 中that在从句he spread everywhere 做成分，充当spread的宾语，为定语从句

​     b 中that在从句tom was a thief中不做任何成分。

+ **从句作用**

​    定语从句相当于形容词，他对先行词起到修饰，描述和限制的作用。

​    同位语从句相当于一个名词，他是前面名词的内容的具体表述。两者是同位的关系。
