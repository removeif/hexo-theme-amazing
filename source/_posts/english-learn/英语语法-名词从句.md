**概念：三种句子充当另外一句子的四种句子成分**

#### 1. 陈述句：句前 + that (当宾语时可省略)

​          b. I’ve learned (that) love, not time heals all wounds.<!-- more -->

#### 2. 一般疑问：变陈述句语序，句前 + whether(当宾语时可用if)

​    a. My question is whether people will live on the moon someday.

​    b. I don’t know if/whether he needs my help. 

#### 3. 特殊疑问：变陈述句语序

​    a. Money is what we are badly in need of. 

| 句子类型 | 引导词                                                       | 从句中作用                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 陈述句   | that                                                         | 不做成分                                                     |
| 一般疑问 | whether, if                                                  | 不做成分                                                     |
| 特殊疑问 | 连接副词when, where, why, how连接代词who, whom, what;        which, whose | 连接副词做状语who, whom, what做主语/表语/宾语which, whose做定语,后+名词连用 |

 

#### it形式主语：it在句首，主句在后面

​    a. It is common knowledge that the moon itself does not give off light.

​    b. It is not known where they came from.

##### it形式宾语：复合宾语中：动词 + it + 宾补 + 宾语从句

​    I find it encouraging how many young women are pursuing careers in

science.

**双宾语：**Could you tell me where the post office is?

**介词后做宾语：**    You should vote for which candidate you assume best.

**形容词后做宾语：**    I am afraid that I can’t come.

**并列宾语从句中that不省略：**    I once read that “” and that “”.

#### reason后的表语从句：引导词用that，不用because.

​    The reason (why) he was dismissed is that he was careless and irresponsible.

**嵌套：**a. I realized that what I said was not exactly what I meant to say.

​      b. The question is how what you have learned can be put into practice.
