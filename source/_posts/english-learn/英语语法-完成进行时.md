#### 现在完成进行时

##### (一)到现在仍在延续的动作

  **1. 与一段时间连用：强调动作的持续性，开始于过去的动作持续到现在，并且还会继续持续**
    常与for + 时间段、since + 时间点、all morning、all day、all week表示段时间的状语连用
    
​    It began raining two hours ago and it’s still raining. It has been raining for two hours.  <!-- more -->

  **2. 可不与时间段连用；表示最近一段时间内正在持续的活动**

​    I have been thinking about changing my job. 我最近一直在考虑换工作。

##### (二)刚刚结束的动作

  **1. 动作持续到说话为止**

​    a. Where have you been? I’ve been looking for you for the last half hour.

​    b. Thank you for the binoculars. I’ve been wanting a pair for ages.

  **2. 不久前刚刚结束的动作(完成时没有的用法)**

​    a. Your friend is out of breath. you ask, “Have you been running?”

​    b. Why are your clothes so dirty? what have you been doing?

​    c. The little boy is dirty from head to foot because he has been playing in the mud.

##### (三)重复发生的的动作

  **说话时刻以前的一段时间内重复发生的动作**

​    a. Every Sunday they meet in the same bar. They’re been going there for years.

​    b. I’ve been getting up early since I entered the college.

​    c. The price has been going up recently. I wonder whether it will remain so.

​    d. You’ve been staying up late again?

##### 与现在完成时比较(一)

**相同点：**

  **1. 都是延续性谓语动作live, learn, study, sleep, snow, wait, work, teach, stay**

  **2. 与时间段连用(这时两种时态几乎没有多大的区别)**

​    a. I have been learning/ have learned English for ten years.

​    b. I have been  living/ have  lived here since 3 years ago.

**不同点：**

  **现在完成时只与段时间连用才能表示这类动作。**

  a. I have worked/ have been working in this company for 3 years.

  b. I have worked in this company(现在不在了，表示过去的经历)

  c. I have been working in this company. (现在还在这家公司)

  d. He has been sleeping/ has slept for three hours.

  e. He has slept(他睡过了，所以现在不困了)

  g. he has been sleeping(现在还在睡)

##### 与现在完成时比较(二)

  **完成进行时强调动作过程**

  **完成时强调动作的结果**

  a. My hands are very dirty. I’ve been painting the house(理由，做的动作过程)

  b. I have painted the house green. The house  was white, but now it’s green.

  c. Sorry about the mess--I’ve been painting the house.

##### 与现在完成时比较(三)

  **1. 短暂动词的完成进行时表示重复。**

​    **短暂动词的完成时不能与一段时间的时间状语连用。但是完成进行时可以，表示重复动作**

​    a. Over the past few years, many towns in the United States have been joining with neighboring communites to  share the costs of government.

​    b. Over the past few years, many towns in the United States have joined with …

​    c.I’ve got up early since I entered the college.

  **2. 重复动作的分割性**

​    **完成进行时表示不间断动作。如果要表达做事情的次数，不能用现在完成进行时**

​    a. I have been sitting in class since 8 o’ clock this morning.

​    b. I have had three classes since 8 o’ clock this morning.

​    c. The phone has been ringing for almost a minute, why doesn’t someone answer it?
​    d. The phone has rung four times this mrning, and each time it has been for Clint.

##### 与现在完成时比较(四)

  **不能用进行时的动词，同样不能用现在完成进行时**

  a. How long have you known Jane?

  b. How long have you been knowing Jane?
