#### 现在完成时(一)：开始于过去的动作一直持续到现在，有可能继续持续。谓语动词为延续性动词

  I have lived here for 3 years. 我仍然住在这里，而且还可能继续住下去。

​    **如果在搬家时说这句话，则live这件事只持续到目前为止。**

  The teacher has taught in this school since I came here. <!-- more -->

  I’ve worked in this company since I left school.

​      **since表明了动作开始的时间点。**

  **有上下问明确告知，动作只持续到说话的时刻为止。**

​    a. A: Have you waited long?

​      B: I’ve waited for three hours.

​    b. I’ve waited for him all day; I don’t want to wait any longer.

##### 特点：

  1. 谓语动词为延续性动词

  2. 动作的发生时间是过去，持续到现在，还可能继续持续下去。

  3. 常常与表示一段时间的时间状语连用，是说明某个状态持续了多久。

##### 与现在完成时搭配的时间状语

  **1. since + 时间点**

​    a. I’ve worked in thiss company since 1980

​    b. I’ve worked in this company since I left school. (从句中一般过去时)

  **2. for + 时间段**

​    a. I’ve worked in this company for three years.

​    b. Great changes  have taken place in Beijing for the past few years.

  **3. 到目前为止：**until now, up until now, up to now,  up till now, so far.

​    a. We have up until now failed to take any action to decide on a common language that would further communication between nations.

  **4. 在最近几世纪/年/月以来：**in the past few years, over the past few years, during the last three months, for the last few centuries, through centuries, throughout history.

​    a. Throughout history man has had to accept the fact that all living things must die, for the very nature of life includes death.

​    b. Through centuries the bizarre anticss of sleepwalkers have puzzled police, perplexed scientists anad fascinated writers.

#### 现在完成时(二)：过去发生但与现在仍有联系的动作或状态

  a. He has broken his leg. 他现在还在医院，所以不能和同学一起郊游。

  b. He broke this leg. 退摔断过，单纯表示一种过去的经历，但现在腿已经好了。

  c. You should have put the milk into icebox; I expect it has become undrinkable by now.

​    **牛奶变质是过去某一时刻的动作，但其影响延续到现在。现在牛奶已经不能喝了。**

##### 第二种现在完成时使用技巧。

  **1. 不与一段时间的时间状语连用：**常见 come, go, leave, kill, die, lose, buy, start, give, marry

​    ~~he has left his hometown for 3 years.~~ 

​    **改正：**

​         a. He left this hometown 3 years ago.

​         b. It’s 3 years since he left this home town.

​         c. He hasn’t come back since he left his hometown 3 years ago.

​         d. He has been away from his home town for 3 years.

  **2. 终止性动词的完成时句子若用否定，表示尚未发生的事情，则可以为一种状态，从而表示延续。**

​    a. I haven’t seen a film for weeks.

​    b. I haven’t heard form my girlfriends since I came to America

​    c. I haven’t bought a pair of shoes for a year.

  **3. 与不确定时间的时间状语连用**

​    **这种完成时，可以同一些表示不确定的时间状语连用：**already, yet, lately, often, just, never

​    a. A: would you like something to eat?

​    	B: No, thanks. I’ve just had dinner.

​    b. The leading expert on sleep in America claims that he has never seen a sleepwalker.

​    c. Has it stopped raining yet?

​    d. He has  already arrived.

​    f.  I have often thought that it would be perfect if we could fly without any aid.

  **4. 具有新闻性质：表示最近才发生的动作，提供新消息。有新闻性质**

​    a. The President has been assassinated.

​    b. He can’t go on holiday because he has broken his leg.

​    **强调的时间内容，而不算是发生的过去具体时间。**

​    **通常的日常对话，以现在完成时开始问答。过去时间咋唉说话人的脑子中已经确定了，则继续用一般过去时。**

​    c. I hear that famous Chinese comedian has died.

​      Really? When did she die?     She was dead late last night.

#### 现在完成时(三)：表示到目前为止的一个时间段内重复发生的动作。

 We have taken three tests so far this week.

##### 其他现在完成时的结构

​    a. This is the most interesting movie that I’ve ever seen 

​    b. This is the best wine I have ever drunk

​    c. This is the hardest job I have ever had.

  **3. 如果是It was the second/ best… that 后面要用过去完成时**

​    a. It was the fifth time that someone had knocked at my door that night.

**总结：一直在持续； 重复发生；影响现状**

##### 现在完成时与一般过去时比较

  **不同时态，表明了说话的时间不同。**

  a. I haven’t seen him this morning.

  b. I didn’t see him this morning.

  a. 句用了现在完成时，而完成时生死要与现在发生联系的。所以a说话的时间是this morning

  b. 句用的是一般过去时，说明this morning已经成为了过去，所以b说话时间是今早后

  c. I have called thim three times this morning.

  d. I called thim three times this morning.

  c. 表示到现在为止的一个是时间段内重复的动作。所以c说话时间是this morning

  d. 过去时，和现在没有什么联系，所以说话时间是今早后

  **延续性动词的两种时态区别**

  a. He lives in Beijing. He has lived here for 3 years. (可能还继续住在这里)

  b. He lived in Beijing for 3 years and then emigrated to America (曾经住过，已经搬走了)

##### 过去完成时：过去某时刻之前就开始的动作；

##### 一把拿过去时与过去完成时的比较

  **1. 两个或以上相继发生的动作，用and 或 but 按动作发生的先后顺序连接，此时要用一般过去时。 过去完成时则强调主语在过去某一时刻回顾更早的动作，具体来说。当我们在讨论过去某一事件时，想到了在这之前已经发生的某事，这时用过去完成时。**

​    a. He opened the door and entered, but found nobody.

​    b. He served in the army for ten years; then retired and married. His children are now at school.

​    c. When I had written my letters I did some gardening.

​    e. When the singer had sung her song, she sat down.如果说when the singer sang her song, she sat down.给中一种印象，这位歌手喜欢坐着唱歌。 

##### 将来完成时：站在将来某一时间来谈某一个动作的完成情况

​    a. By five o’ clock this afternoon the spaceship will have traveled eleven times round the world. 

#### 完成时的三种思维用法

​     **1. 延续到现在的动作或状态，可能继续延续，也可能到现在为止。**

​     **2. 过去发生但与现在仍有联系的动作或状态。对现在有影响。**

​     **3. 到目前为止的一个时间段内重复发的动作。**
