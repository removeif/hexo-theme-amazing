##### 主格人称代词

  **作用：主句或从句中做主语**

​        She is my daughter.

​        It was he who helped me when I was in trouble. <!-- more -->

  **顺序： you, he and I  ；  We, you and they（I总是 放在最后）**

 

###### 表示泛指的主格代词

  **one：任何人，包括说话人**

​       One is knocking at the door.(错误，说话人不算，所以不能用one)

​       Somebody is knocking at the door.

​       One后面使用的代词，美国一般用he，him，himself，his.

  **We/You/They 可以表示泛指：人们**

​       They say = People say or It is said

​       They say it is going to be a cold winter.

**she(her)的拟人化：表示country, motherland, moon, earth, ship.**

​      The ship lost most of her rigging in the storm

##### 宾格人称代词

  **作用：做宾语（也可做表语）**

​        I like her.

​        Who is it?  It’s me.

​        **注意：做表语时，后面跟定语从句时，需要用主格人称代词。**

​        It was he in whom we had the greatest faith(he在从句中做介词宾语)

  **主格和宾格人称代词可以做同位语：**

​        We teachers should be patient with students.

​        Our teachers are all nice to us students.

**做宾语时的位置**

  **直接宾语前：** He bought me a pen as birthday gift.

  **直接宾语后：**He bought a pen for me as a birthday gift  ;  I’ve lent much monery to him.

  **若直接宾语是人称代词，只能置后，但是不适用于不定代词：**

​              I will give it to you.  

​              I‘ll show you something  ;  I didn’t give Rex any.

 **在短语动词中间：**Hand them in  ;  throw it away  ;  pick it up.

​                 若是名词，则中间和后边都可：hand your papers in = hand in your papers.

##### 物主代词(名词性&形容词性)

**作用：人称代词的所有格形式，表所有关系。**

**形容词性：不能单独使用：** Your book is over there  ;  His sister is lovely.

​      表强调时后+own：I wish I had my own house.

**名词性：单独使用；避免重复：**This is not my book. Mine(=my book) is in my bog.

​       of + 名词性物主代词： a friend of mine  ;  a teacher of hers= a teacher of her own.

##### 反身代词

  **必须主语宾语为同一人时，做宾语：**God helps those who help themselves.

  **强调主语：**

​           He himself went to visit the old lady(他亲自去看望那个老太太的)

​           **不产生歧义下可置后：**

​                    He went to visit the old lady himself.

​                    He spoke to the boss himself.（有歧义）

  **强调宾语：反身代词在宾语后**

​           He saw Tom himself(他看到Tom本人了)

​           I will send this gift to John himself(给john本人，不是通过转交)

  **介词+反身动词**

​           **（1）by oneself：独自一人地**

​                         I went there by myself(我自己一个人去了那里)

​                         I went there myself(我亲自去了那)

​           **（2）of oneself：自动地**

​                         The door opened of itself(门自动地开了)
